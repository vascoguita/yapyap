# 0004. Extension isolation and trust model

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-18

## Context

Extensions are third-party code running next to private conversations. An extension
may be buggy, compromised, or malicious. The design must hold even if an extension
is fully hostile: it must not read anything it was not granted, send messages,
reach undeclared hosts, read other extensions' data, impersonate WhatsApp's UI,
or exhaust the machine.

## Decision

### Package format

An extension is a `.yapyap-extension` zip containing `manifest.json`, an ESM entry
point, and static assets. The manifest is validated against
`packages/sdk/schema/manifest.schema.json` (published with the SDK and on the
docs site). Fields: `id` (reverse-DNS), `name`, `version` (semver), `author`
(`name`, optional `url`), `apiVersion` (semver range against the SDK),
`entry`, `activation` (see the amendments), `capabilities[]`, `network.hosts[]`, `contributes` (commands,
composer actions, context-menu items, settings JSON Schema, optional panel),
and `signature` (`publicKey`, `algorithm: "ed25519"`, `value`).

### Signing

- The **signed payload** is the canonical JSON (sorted keys, no whitespace)
  of `{ manifest without signature, files: [[path, sha256], ...] sorted by
path }`. Every file in the archive must appear in that list. Extra,
  missing or modified files fail verification.
- Keys are Ed25519. The `extension-sign` CLI takes a PKCS#8 PEM private key and
  never writes or prints private key material. The manifest carries the
  public key as base64 SPKI DER.
- The key **fingerprint** is the SHA-256 of the raw 32-byte public key, shown
  as colon-grouped hex.
- **First-party trust anchors** are an array of SPKI PEM public keys compiled
  into the app (`TRUST_ANCHORS` in `packages/extension-sign/src/anchors.ts`).
  The first is the repository variable `EXTENSION_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY`, and CI
  fails if they differ. A first-party extension, meaning any extension ID under
  `org.guita.yapyap.`, must be signed by an anchor; nobody else can publish
  under that prefix. CI signs first-party extensions with the `EXTENSION_SIGNING_KEY` secret.
  To rotate the key, ship the new anchor in a release, sign with the new key
  from the next release, then remove the old anchor one release later
  (documented in CONTRIBUTING).
- **Third-party** extensions use trust on first use. At install, the user sees
  the author, the fingerprint, and every requested capability and network
  host. On consent, the key is pinned to the extension ID (its fingerprint is
  stored with the extension's grants in `<userData>/extensions/.extensions.json`). An update signed by a different key is
  rejected. `decideTrust` in `packages/extension-sign` makes these decisions.
- Third-party extensions are fully supported, but YapYap does not review them.
  Their consent window says plainly that YapYap has not reviewed the extension
  and that the user installs it at their own risk, and **Install** stays
  disabled until the user ticks an acknowledgement. The main process
  enforces this too: it refuses a third-party or unsigned install whose
  answer lacks the acknowledgement, whatever the page sends. The Extensions
  window keeps marking such extensions as "Third-party" or "Unsigned", so they
  never pass for YapYap's own.
- **URL installs** require a pinned `sha256-<base64>` integrity value next to
  the URL. A mismatch aborts before anything is unpacked.
- **Marketplace installs** take the archive's SHA-256 and signer from the
  signed extension index (ADR 0014). Reviewed third-party extensions listed there
  skip the unreviewed-extension acknowledgement, since the maintainer reviewed
  that exact archive; the consent window still shows everything above.
- **Unsigned** extensions load only in Developer Mode (`extensions.developerMode`),
  with a persistent "Unsigned" badge in the chrome, and the Extensions window
  warns while Developer Mode is on. Developer Mode is never exported with
  the settings or changed by an import (ADR 0006), so a file someone hands
  the user cannot turn it on.
- An update that adds capabilities or hosts is staged and does not activate
  until the user re-approves.

### Unpacking

Archives are read in memory with fflate (`readExtensionArchive` in
`packages/extension-sign`). Limits: 20 MB archive, 512 entries, 10 MB per file
and 50 MB unpacked in total, checked against the declared sizes and again
against the bytes actually unpacked, since headers can lie. Entry names must be plain relative paths: absolute paths, drive letters,
backslashes, control characters, `.`, `..` and empty segments are rejected,
as are names that collide on case-insensitive file systems. Links are never
created: an entry stored as a link unpacks as an ordinary file holding its
target's name, which the signature covers. Files are written
to `<userData>/extensions/<id>/<version>/` only after the signature verifies.

### Runtime isolation

- Each enabled extension runs in its own hidden `BrowserWindow` (never shown),
  with `sandbox: true`, `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`,
  `webviewTag: false`, and a partition `extension:<id>` that is non-persistent
  unless the extension holds `storage:local`, in which case it gets
  `persist:extension:<id>`. Separate partitions are separate browser contexts,
  so extensions never share a renderer process, storage, cookies or cache with
  each other or with WhatsApp.
- Code is served only from `extension://<id>/`, a privileged scheme registered
  **on that extension's session only**. The handler serves files strictly inside
  the install directory and sets
  `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:`.
  `eval`, inline scripts and remote scripts are therefore impossible.
  Only an extension holding `local-model` gets a wider policy, described
  in the amendments.
- `webRequest.onBeforeRequest` on the extension session cancels every request
  except `extension://<id>/*` and `https://` hosts that are both declared and
  approved. Hosts the user enters at runtime (for example a custom AI
  endpoint) go through an explicit permission prompt before they join the
  allowlist.
  The extension CSP adds `connect-src https:` so these requests reach the
  filter, which decides: only plain `https://` on the default port, without
  credentials, to a host name the manifest schema would accept. A new host
  raises one prompt at a time (Deny is the default); an allowed host is
  added to the extension's record, and a refused one is not asked about again
  until YapYap restarts. An extension that already holds 32 hosts is not asked
  about more.
  The extension CSP also lets plain HTTP to `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` and
  `[::1]` reach the filter, which allows it, on any port, only to an extension
  holding `local-network` (#103), for a model server the user runs on
  this computer. Other machines on the local network are never reachable.
  Even with the grant, each server on this computer (host and port) is
  reachable only once the user approved it for the extension, through the
  same one-at-a-time prompt as a new host, with Deny the default; approvals
  are kept in the record (`localServers`, at most 8), and a refused server
  is not asked about again until YapYap restarts (#430). Local servers such
  as Ollama refuse a request whose `Origin` they do not list, and an
  extension's never is. So requests to an approved server leave the
  extension's session without an `Origin`, and the session answers CORS for
  them itself: the extension's own origin, any method and headers, and
  `204` for a preflight. That lifts the protection the server keeps against
  web pages, so it happens only for the one server the user chose; every
  other service on this computer stays unreachable.
- **Finding models on this computer** (#456, C37). With `local-network`,
  an extension may call `host.localModels.find()`, so that someone who
  already runs a model gets the assistant working with one click. YapYap
  looks, never the extension, and only at four fixed loopback addresses
  (ADR 0001). The first call shows one native prompt naming the extension
  and the servers it checks ("Let AI assistant look for AI models on this
  computer?"), with Deny the default. The answer is kept in the record
  (`modelSearch`), so YapYap asks once and a refusal holds; turning
  `local-network` off or on in the Extensions window forgets it, which is
  how someone who refused can be asked again. Taking `local-network` back
  refuses the call before anything is asked. The extension gets plain
  data that YapYap builds itself: up to four servers, each as `host:port`
  for a real port, its `http://localhost:<port>/v1` address and up to 20
  model IDs, each checked to be at most 200 characters without control
  characters. Finding a server approves
  nothing: the extension's first request to it still raises the
  per-server prompt above.
- Extension pages are a trust zone of their own (`extension`). The navigation
  guard confines them: they open no windows and no links in the browser or
  other apps, and cannot navigate away from `extension://<id>/`. The host page
  is generated by YapYap and only loads the manifest's `entry` as a module.
- **Single channel.** The preload does one thing: it receives a
  `MessagePort` from main and hands it to the page with `window.postMessage`.
  There is no `ipcRenderer` access.
- **RPC.** Messages are `{ id, method, params }`. In main, each message
  passes four checks in order, and a failure stops it:
  1. schema validation (TypeBox, interpreter mode)
  2. capability check against grants for (extension, account)
  3. rate limit (token bucket per extension)
  4. execution with a timeout

  Every call either returns a result or a typed error (`invalid`,
  `not-granted`, `rate-limited`, `timeout` or `failed`, with a short
  message that never carries the cause or the parameters). A message
  without a usable ID gets no reply. The bucket holds 40 calls and refills
  at 5 per second (it held 20 until the AI assistant's panel and in-chat
  bar, which share it, needed more for one action; see C36 in ADR 0008); a call times out after 10 seconds, except
  `localModels.find`, which waits up to two minutes for the user to
  answer YapYap's question. A method may refuse with `not-granted` itself,
  as `localModels.find` does once the user said no; any other failure
  stays `failed`. Each page load gets a fresh port.

- **Bootstrap.** The host page loads YapYap's own script from
  `/__yapyap/host.js`, a path no extension file can take. It takes the first
  port the preload hands over, builds the SDK's `ExtensionHost` on it (calls
  made before the port arrives wait for it), then imports the manifest's
  `entry` and calls its `activate`.

- **Resource limits.** `app.getAppMetrics()` samples each extension's renderer
  PID. Sustained CPU or working-set overruns terminate the renderer. Three
  terminations within a window disable the extension and notify the user.
  YapYap samples every 5 seconds; more than 50% CPU or 256 MB of working
  set in 3 samples in a row restarts the extension, and a third restart within
  10 minutes stops it until YapYap restarts or the extension is installed
  again. An extension holding `local-model` has no CPU limit and a
  memory limit of 4 GiB, or half the computer's memory if that is less
  (see the amendments).

### Capabilities

Capabilities are granted per extension **and per account**, and can be revoked at
any time in settings.
At install the user approves the manifest's capabilities and hosts for the
whole extension. The Extensions window can then take any of them back, and the
ones that act on the account on screen (`chat:read-active`,
`chat:read-unread-summary`, `composer:insert-draft`, `composer:read-draft`) account by account.
The record keeps these as `revoked` and `revokedIn`; an update keeps them,
and turning a grant back on can never give more than was approved. Grants
are read on every call and request, so a change applies to the next one.
YapYap listens on no port or socket, and a test fails if its code ever
starts to.

| `calls:record`             | Ask YapYap to record the call on screen, which only the user starts (ADR 0015)                                                                                                                                                           |
| `local-model`              | Run an AI model in its own page: WebAssembly, `blob:` workers, threads and higher limits (#457)                                                                                                                                          |

The key-value store (#301) keeps each extension's values as JSON in
`<userData>/extensions/.storage/<id>.json`, readable by the user alone, with
the ID taken from YapYap, never from the call. Keys are up to 256
characters, a store holds up to 1 MiB, and a write past that fails.

Removing an extension (#332), once the user confirms, stops it and closes its
panel, clears both partitions it may have had (an update can add or drop
`storage:local`), deletes its record and then its folder, and deletes its
key-value store and every secret under `<id>/`. Its audit log entries stay,
since they hold no parameters or results.

There is **no API to send a message**, and no capability that returns DOM
nodes, HTML, or arbitrary page script execution. All chat data comes from the
WhatsApp adapter as validated plain objects.

### UI contributions

Commands, composer actions, context-menu items and settings forms are
declarative. YapYap renders them in its own chrome, with the extension's name and
icon in a visually distinct style, outside the WhatsApp view, so an extension can
never draw over the composer or imitate WhatsApp. An optional panel opens
in a window of its own, on the extension's session and under its CSP, titled
with the extension's name by YapYap (C25 in ADR 0008).

Commands are the first contribution YapYap renders (#98): those of the
running extensions appear in the menu under **Extension Commands**, each labelled
`<extension name>: <title>`. Picking one sends `{ command }` on the extension's
port, and the bootstrap runs the handler the extension registered with
`commands.onRun`; a handler that fails affects only itself. Only commands
the manifest declares can be sent.

The settings form is the second (#98): YapYap renders only a plain object
of `string`, `number`, `integer` and `boolean` fields with titles,
descriptions, choices and bounds, so an extension cannot shape YapYap's window
beyond labels and simple inputs. Values are checked against the form when
saved and again when the extension reads them with `settings.get`, which needs
no capability because the user filled them in for that extension.

Composer actions and context-menu items are the third (#98). They join
YapYap's native right-click menu in WhatsApp, after YapYap's own items,
labelled `<extension name>: <title>`: composer actions on the message box,
`message` items on the open conversation, `chat` items on the chat list.
To tell these apart, the adapter checks which landmark holds the clicked
point and returns only that, never page text, and only when some extension
has items. Picking one runs the extension's command, as the menu does; the
extension then reads what its capabilities allow. Where WhatsApp shows a menu
of its own, Chromium shows none, and so neither do extension items.

Panels are the last (#98). **Extension Commands** lists each running extension's
panel after its commands. Picking one opens the panel's window, or brings
it forward. YapYap serves its page at `/__yapyap/panel.html`, which links
YapYap's panel style (`/__yapyap/panel.css`, #396) and loads the
manifest's `panel.entry` as a module. The window has no preload, so the
panel gets no port; it reaches the host API only through its extension's
hidden page, which shares its origin. The window's title is
`<extension name>: <panel title>`, and the page cannot change it. The panel
closes when its extension stops or restarts.

### Audit log

Each capability use appends `{ time, extensionId, accountId, capability, method,
outcome }` to a local, rotating, user-visible log. Message content,
parameters and return values are never logged. The log is
`<userData>/extensions/audit.log`, one JSON line per call to an operation
YapYap offers (names an extension makes up are never written, since they could
carry text), moved aside to `audit.log.1` past 256 KiB. The Extensions window
shows the latest 50 calls. `accountId` joins once grants are per account
(#94).

## Amendments

- 2026-10-31 (#457, the maintainer's decision): `local-model`, a whole-extension
  capability shown at install as running an AI model on this computer, which
  can use a lot of its processor and memory. It exists so the AI assistant
  can run a private model with wllama, llama.cpp compiled to WebAssembly,
  shipped in the signed extension; the weights it downloads are data, and
  no code is fetched at run time. Only a holder's responses change, and
  YapYap reads the grant on every response and every sample, so taking it
  back applies from the page's next load:
  - The CSP adds `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` to `script-src`, `worker-src blob:`
    and `'self'` to `connect-src`. WebAssembly can be compiled, but
    JavaScript still cannot be evaluated, and scripts still come only from
    the extension's own files. Blob workers inherit the page's policy, so
    they load nothing the page could not. `'self'` lets the engine fetch its
    `.wasm`, which YapYap serves as `application/wasm` for streaming
    compilation; the `extension` scheme has `supportFetchAPI` for this, and
    other extensions still cannot fetch their own files, since their
    `connect-src` lacks `'self'`.
  - Every response carries `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and
    `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`, so the pages are
    cross-origin isolated and get `SharedArrayBuffer`, which the engine
    needs for several CPU threads; WebGPU gives no adapter on common
    integrated graphics. Workers started from the extension's scripts take
    their policy from those scripts, which is why it is on every response
    and not only the pages. Isolation refuses cross-origin replies that do
    not opt in with CORS or `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`. Extension pages
    reach other servers only with `fetch`, which sends CORS requests; the
    providers answer them, and YapYap answers CORS for approved servers on
    this computer, so both keep working.
  - The resource guard does not limit a holder's CPU: inference keeps
    every thread busy for as long as it answers, and the extension runs in
    a renderer of its own, so YapYap's windows keep their processes. Memory
    is limited to 4 GiB, which holds a model of 1 to 2 GB with its context
    and the engine's buffers, or half the computer's memory if that is
    less, so a smaller computer keeps enough for everything else. Over it
    for three samples in a row restarts the extension, and a third restart
    within ten minutes stops it, as for any extension.

  The tradeoff is C38 in ADR 0008.

- 2026-10-31 (#457, second part): the AI assistant holds `local-model` and
  runs its private model with wllama 3.8.1. Its one `.wasm` is a file of
  the signed extension, and the assistant turns wllama's compatibility
  mode off, which would otherwise fetch another build from a CDN, so every
  byte that runs is signed. The weights are data: each model is pinned in
  the extension by a commit-pinned Hugging Face address, its size and its
  SHA-256, checked as it streams in, and a file that does not match is
  deleted. They are downloaded only on the user's click, from the hosts
  the manifest declares (`huggingface.co`, and `us.aws.cdn.hf.co`, where it
  redirects), and kept in the extension's origin private file system on
  its persistent partition. For E2E tests, an unpackaged YapYap given
  `YAPYAP_TEST_BUILT_IN_MODEL` serves that model's address, size and hash
  at `/__yapyap/test-model.json`, to `local-model` holders only, in place
  of the pinned ones; a packaged YapYap ignores the variable and answers
  404, and no extension can ship a file at that path.
- 2026-11-01 (ADR 0017): the AI assistant is part of YapYap, so the
  capabilities that existed only for it are gone: `assistant:bar` and
  `host.assistant`, `local-model` with its wider CSP, cross-origin
  isolation and limits, and `host.localModels.find()` with its prompt.
  The test-model path and the `extension` scheme's fetch support went
  with them. Every extension is again under the one policy and the same
  limits described above.
- 2026-11-01 (#495): extensions run only while needed, when they say they
  can. The manifest gains `activation`, which the schema checks:
  - `startup`, the default, runs the extension from launch to quit, as
    before, so an extension that works on its own keeps working.
  - `on-demand` starts the extension's hidden window only when the user
    runs one of its commands (from the menu, a shortcut or a right click)
    or opens its panel, which reaches the host API through the hidden page.
    A command picked while the page loads is sent once the page has its
    port, and the bootstrap holds it until `activate` has finished, so its
    handler is registered. YapYap stops the window once the extension made
    no call, ran no command and had no panel open for five minutes, checked
    every minute; every call it makes counts as use, and no host call takes
    longer than ten seconds, so an extension at work is never stopped.
  - Commands, composer actions, context-menu items and panels are read from
    the manifest when YapYap starts, so they are listed whether the
    extension runs or not. The menus list those of the installed, enabled
    extensions, not only the running ones.

  Nothing else changes: each start is the same sandboxed window on the
  same partition, with a fresh port, served with the same schema,
  capability and rate checks, and the resource guard watches it while it
  runs. A fresh port means a fresh token bucket, as on any page load, but
  an extension cannot start or stop itself: only the user's command or
  panel starts it, and only five idle minutes stop it. YapYap's own
  extensions declare `on-demand`. Keeping the old lifetime as the default
  is C44 in ADR 0008.

## Consequences

- Extensions cannot do anything outside these capabilities, by design. New needs
  require a new capability, an ADR, and a malicious-extension test.
- Each enabled extension costs one renderer process while it runs, and
  process count is part of the performance budget. An `on-demand` extension
  costs none until it is needed (#495).
