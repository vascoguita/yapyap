# 0003. Packaging and update channels

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-18

## Context

WhatsApp Web desktop users install software in very different ways. Some
package formats have their own update mechanism, and a self-updating app
inside them would conflict with it, break signatures, or fail silently.
Updates are a code-delivery channel, so they must be verified.

## Decision

### Formats

| OS      | Format                                   | Arch            | Built by                       | Updates                                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Linux   | Flatpak (Electron BaseApp 26.08 + zypak) | x86_64, aarch64 | flatpak-builder                | System (Flathub / `flatpak update`)             |
| Linux   | AppImage                                 | x86_64, aarch64 | electron-builder               | **Self-update** (electron-updater)              |
| Linux   | DEB                                      | x64, arm64      | electron-builder               | System (apt)                                    |
| Linux   | RPM                                      | x86_64, aarch64 | electron-builder               | System (dnf/zypper)                             |
| Arch    | AUR `yapyap-bin`                         | x86_64, aarch64 | PKGBUILD generated per release | System (AUR helper)                             |
| Windows | NSIS installer                           | x64, arm64      | electron-builder               | **Self-update**                                 |
| Windows | Portable                                 | x64, arm64      | electron-builder               | Notice only, links to the release               |
| macOS   | Universal DMG + ZIP                      | arm64 + x64     | electron-builder               | **Self-update**, only when signed and notarized |

Linux arm64 artifacts are built natively on `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runners.
Windows arm64 is cross-built on x64.

### Install-channel detection

Each package format is built in its own electron-builder invocation, which
stamps `installChannel` (`appimage`, `nsis`, `portable`, `dmg`, `deb`, `rpm`,
`aur` or `flatpak`) into the packaged `package.json` through
`extraMetadata`. At runtime the channel is cross-checked with environment
evidence: `FLATPAK_ID` and `/.flatpak-info` for Flatpak, `APPIMAGE` for
AppImage, `PORTABLE_EXECUTABLE_DIR` for portable, and the code-signing status
on macOS. The updater only starts when **both** the build marker and the
runtime evidence agree on a self-updating channel. Any mismatch
falls back to `manual`: no update checks at all. A pure function maps
`(marker, evidence) → policy`, with tests for every combination
(`src/main/updates/update-policy.ts`). The AUR package is repackaged from
the DEB, so it carries the `deb` marker; both are `system`. "Signed" on
macOS means a Developer ID signature, because electron-builder signs every
build ad hoc. Copy Diagnostics shows the policy and channel.

| Policy        | Behavior                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `self-update` | electron-updater checks GitHub Releases, downloads, verifies and installs on restart with the user's consent |
| `notify`      | Portable build: checks the GitHub Releases API, shows "new version available" with a link, never downloads   |
| `system`      | Flatpak, DEB, RPM, AUR: no update checks. "About" says updates come from the system package manager.         |
| `manual`      | Development builds and any marker the evidence contradicts: no update checks; the user updates by hand       |

### Verification

- electron-updater verifies the SHA-512 of each artifact against `latest*.yml`.
- On Windows it verifies the Authenticode publisher (`publisherName`) when
  the build is signed. On macOS Squirrel.Mac verifies the code signature.
- Update metadata is served only over HTTPS from GitHub Releases. Downgrades
  are refused, and pre-releases reach only users who opt in to beta updates
  (#184).
- **Betas before every stable release (#184):** each `vX.Y.Z` follows at
  least one `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` GitHub pre-release. The release PR carries a
  `Beta gate` check that fails until the newest beta of its version has been
  published for at least **3 days**. A security fix may skip the wait, never
  the beta, by stating `Security release: <reason>` on its own line in the
  release PR. Betas come from the manual **Beta release** workflow
  (`beta.yml`), which shares packaging, smoke tests and publishing
  (`publish.yml`) with stable releases.
- Every release asset is listed in `SHA256SUMS`, covered by a build provenance
  attestation (`actions/attest-build-provenance`), and accompanied by a
  CycloneDX SBOM.

### Signing

- macOS signing and notarization run only when `APPLE_*` secrets exist.
  Unsigned macOS builds ship, but their updater policy is `notify`.
- Windows Authenticode signing runs only when `WIN_CSC_*` secrets exist.
- AUR publishing runs only when `AUR_SSH_KEY` exists.
- Missing secrets skip their step with a notice in the job summary. They
  never fail the build.

### Desktop integration

The AppStream metainfo `org.guita.YapYap.metainfo.xml` and the
desktop entry `org.guita.YapYap.desktop` are validated in CI with
`appstreamcli validate` and `desktop-file-validate`. The Flatpak manifest
follows Flathub's requirements: no `--filesystem=home`; notification, tray
and background portals; `--talk-name=org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher` for the
tray.

### Smoke tests

Each built artifact is installed on a clean runner (`dpkg -i` on Ubuntu,
`dnf install` in a Fedora container, `flatpak install` of the bundle,
`makepkg -si` in an Arch container, a silent NSIS install, a DMG mount) and
launched with a loopback fake WhatsApp origin (see
[ADR 0005](0005-test-strategy.md)). The test asserts that the window opens and
the fake page loads.

## Consequences

- There are three update behaviors to test. Most of the logic is in pure
  functions.
- Without paid signing certificates, macOS users won't get auto-updates and
  Windows users will see SmartScreen warnings. Both are tracked as
  `needs-maintainer` issues.
