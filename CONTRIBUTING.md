# Contributing to YapYap

Thanks for helping make YapYap better. This guide covers how to set up your
environment, how changes flow into `master`, and the rules every change follows.
By participating you agree to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ground rules

1. **Priorities.** When requirements conflict, the order is: security, then
   correctness, then user privacy, then confidentiality, then tests and
   coverage, then performance, then code style. Record any conflict in
   [ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-requirement-conflicts.md).
2. **Never automate a real WhatsApp account.** Tests use the local fake
   WhatsApp page in `apps/desktop/test/fake-whatsapp/`.
3. **Privacy.** No telemetry. Never log, persist or put in fixtures any
   message content, phone numbers, names or secrets.
4. **Clean room.** Implement features from their description. Never copy code
   from other projects whose licenses are incompatible with MIT.
5. **Comments explain why, never what.** Good reasons for a comment are
   non-obvious constraints, WhatsApp quirks, security reasoning, and
   workarounds (with a link to the YapYap issue). No commented-out code, and no
   TODOs: open an issue instead.
6. **Tests.** 100% line and branch coverage. Coverage-ignore directives are
   forbidden.
7. **Dependencies.** Keep them minimal and justify each new one in the PR
   description or an ADR.

## Development setup

You need Node.js 24 LTS and pnpm (version pinned in `package.json`, enable it
with `corepack enable`). On Linux, run E2E tests as
`dbus-run-session -- xvfb-run -a pnpm test:e2e`: `xvfb-run` keeps their
windows off your desktop, and a private session bus keeps their tray icons
and notifications off it too.

```sh
pnpm install            # install (frozen lockfile in CI)
pnpm dev                # run the desktop app with hot reload
pnpm lint               # ESLint + Prettier check + knip
pnpm typecheck          # tsc across the workspace
pnpm test               # unit + integration tests
pnpm test:coverage      # tests with the 100% coverage gate
pnpm test:e2e           # Playwright E2E (on Linux, wrap it as described above)
pnpm test:mutation      # Stryker mutation testing
pnpm build              # build every package
pnpm package            # build installers for the current OS
```

`CLAUDE.md` has the full command list and an architecture map.

## Workflow

1. Pick an issue and move it to **In Progress** on the
   [project board](https://github.com/users/vascoguita/projects/5).
2. Create a branch `type/short-description` (for example
   `feat/tray-unread-count`).
3. Make small, focused commits. Each one builds and passes tests on its own.
4. Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
   and **must be signed**.
5. Open a PR that links the issue (`Closes #N`) and includes test evidence.
   Update `docs/progress.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` if your change affects it.
6. When checks are green, rebase onto the latest `master`, push with
   `--force-with-lease`, and wait for checks again.
7. Merge with a merge commit (`gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch`). Squash
   and rebase merges are disabled so that branch commits keep their
   signatures.

See [ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-git-and-merge-strategy.md) for the reasoning.

UI text lives in `apps/desktop/src/shared/messages/locales/en.json`. After
changing it, run `node scripts/src/bin/i18n-types.ts`. Translations follow
[docs/translations.md](docs/translations.md).

### Website screenshots

Pictures of YapYap's own windows, such as Settings and the AI assistant, come
from `pnpm screenshots` (see the commands in CLAUDE.md), on a showcase page
with invented people. The main window's pictures show the real WhatsApp: the
maintainer takes them on their own account, after every name, photo and
message on screen has been replaced with invented ones, and checks each
picture before it is committed. Never commit a screenshot of anyone's real
chats.

### Visual baselines

`apps/desktop/e2e/theme.spec.ts` compares the app chrome against screenshots
kept per OS under `apps/desktop/e2e/__screenshots__/<platform>/`. Fonts and
native controls differ between operating systems and machines, so baselines
come from CI, never from a local run:

1. Push the change. The E2E job fails on each OS where a baseline is missing
   or no longer matches.
2. Download that job's `playwright-report-<os>` artifact and copy each
   `*-actual.png` from `test-results/` to the matching baseline path, without
   the `-actual` suffix.
3. Look at every new image before committing it.

## Repository settings

These settings are applied through the GitHub API and must stay in place.

- **Merging:** merge commits only (squash and rebase disabled), auto-merge
  allowed, head branches deleted after merge.
- **Security:** secret scanning with push protection, Dependabot alerts and
  security updates, private vulnerability reporting. Discussions are enabled.
- **Pages:** the source is GitHub Actions, not a branch.
- **Actions:** the default workflow token is read-only, and workflows may open pull requests (release-please needs this). Each workflow requests only the permissions it needs.
- **Rulesets:** stored as JSON in [`.github/rulesets/`](.github/rulesets/).
  - `master`: pull request required, merge commits only, required status
    checks (`CI result` for the CI workflow, plus CodeQL, dependency review,
    audit, PR title and docs build), signed commits, no force push, no
    deletion, conversation resolution required. Branches need not be up to
    date until M7 (#210, ADR 0007).
  - `release tags`: `v*` tags cannot be deleted, moved or updated.

  After changing a ruleset file (for example when a check of a workflow
  other than CI is added or renamed), apply it:

  ```sh
  id=$(gh api repos/vascoguita/yapyap/rulesets --jq '.[] | select(.name=="master") | .id')
  gh api -X PUT "repos/vascoguita/yapyap/rulesets/$id" --input .github/rulesets/master.json
  ```

## Secrets and maintainer-only steps

The pipelines skip steps whose secrets are missing, and print a notice in the
job summary instead of failing.

Issues that need one of these are labelled `needs-maintainer`.

### Automation app

Pull requests opened with the workflow token never trigger workflows, so
release-please and the pinned-versions job use a GitHub App instead. Its
tokens expire after an hour, are limited to this repository, and its commits
are signed by GitHub. To set it up:

1. Create a private GitHub App owned by the maintainer, with webhooks off and
   these repository permissions: Contents, Pull requests and Issues (read and
   write). Nothing else.
2. Install it on `vascoguita/yapyap` only.
3. Generate a private key, store it, and delete the downloaded file:
   `gh secret set AUTOMATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY --repo vascoguita/yapyap < key.pem`
4. Store the app's Client ID:
   `gh variable set AUTOMATION_APP_CLIENT_ID --repo vascoguita/yapyap --body <client id>`

To rotate the key, generate a new one, store it, then delete the old one in
the app's settings.

### Package repository key

The apt and dnf repositories (#344) are signed with an OpenPGP key that only
the maintainer holds. Create it on your own computer, never in CI:

```sh
export GNUPGHOME=$(mktemp -d)
gpg --batch --passphrase '' --quick-gen-key 'YapYap packages <packages@guita.org>' ed25519 sign 5y
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys | gh secret set PACKAGES_SIGNING_KEY --repo vascoguita/yapyap
gpg --fingerprint
rm -rf "$GNUPGHOME"
```

The current key, created on 2026-10-25 and expiring on 2031-10-24, has the
fingerprint `789C C8E9 F293 6C76 5224 918B 6773 94EA 2E01 721E`; the
install guide publishes it, so update both when the key changes.

Keep an offline backup before removing `GNUPGHOME` if you want to be able
to extend the key's expiry; otherwise rotate it by repeating these steps
before it expires. Users import the new public key from
`https://packages.guita.org/yapyap.gpg` (apt) or accept it in dnf. The
Cloudflare token for `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is an account API token with the
**Pages Write** permission on the account that holds `guita.org`, and
nothing else.

## Plugin marketplace

The marketplace (ADR 0014) lists the plugins in `marketplace/plugins/`, one
`<id>.json` per plugin, and the pulled versions in `marketplace/revoked.json`.
The package repositories workflow builds `plugins/index.json` from them,
downloads and checks every archive, signs the index with
`PLUGIN_SIGNING_KEY`, and deploys it to packages.guita.org every Monday and
whenever `marketplace/` changes on `master`. The index expires 30 days after
it is signed, so a stopped schedule takes the marketplace down within a
month: re-run **Package repositories** by hand if it fails.

To list a new version of an official plugin:

1. Release YapYap. The release carries the signed
   `<id>-<version>.yapyap-plugin` of each first-party plugin.
2. Add the version to the plugin's entry, with the release asset's URL as
   `source`, its `sha256-<base64>` hash (`openssl dgst -sha256 -binary
<file> | base64`), the oldest YapYap version that runs it, and when the
   release was published.
3. Check it locally: `node scripts/src/bin/marketplace-index.ts marketplace`.
   CI runs the same check on every pull request.

To list a reviewed third-party version from a plugin submission issue:

1. Download the archive, check its SHA-256 against the submission, and
   verify it: `node packages/plugin-sign/src/bin/yapyap-plugin-sign.ts
verify <file>` prints the signer, which must match the submission (and
   the entry's `signer` for later versions).
2. Review it against the checklist in
   [the plugin guide](https://yapyap.guita.org/plugins/marketplace#the-review-checklist):
   unpack it and read every file, compare it with the tag in the
   repository, and check each capability, host and the privacy policy.
3. Upload the unchanged archive to the release that holds reviewed
   archives. Where that is is still to be decided (#419), so no
   third-party plugin can be listed until then.
4. Open a pull request adding or updating `marketplace/plugins/<id>.json`
   with `review: "reviewed"`, the `repository`, and the version's `tag`,
   with `source` pointing at that asset. Link the submission.

To take a plugin down, add the version, or `"*"` for all of them, to
`revoked.json` with the signer's fingerprint and a reason the user will
read, and merge it: the index is signed and deployed again at once. Keep
the entry, so the reason stays with the plugin's history.

## Plugin signing key rotation

First-party plugins are verified against public keys embedded in the app.
To rotate the key without breaking installed plugins:

1. Generate a new Ed25519 key pair offline:
   `openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out new.pem`, then
   `openssl pkey -in new.pem -pubout`. Never commit or log the private key.
2. Add the new public key to `TRUST_ANCHORS` in
   `packages/plugin-sign/src/anchors.ts` (keep the old one) and ship that in
   a release.
3. In a later release, update the `PLUGIN_SIGNING_KEY` secret and the
   `PLUGIN_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY` variable, move the new key to the front of
   `TRUST_ANCHORS` (CI checks that the variable is the first anchor), and
   sign first-party plugins with the new key.
4. One release after that, remove the old public key from the anchors.

## Reporting bugs and security issues

Use the issue forms for bugs and features. Report vulnerabilities privately as
described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Releases

Every stable release follows a beta (ADR 0003, #184). The release PR's
`Beta gate` check fails until a `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` pre-release of the same
version has been published. How long a beta stays out before the release is
the maintainer's call.

To cut a beta, run the **Beta release** workflow with the coming stable
version, from the Actions tab or with
`gh workflow run beta.yml --repo vascoguita/yapyap -f version=0.1.0`. It
numbers the next `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, creates the GitHub pre-release from the
current `master`, and packages, smoke-tests and publishes it exactly like a
stable release (`publish.yml` is shared), except that betas skip the AUR.

[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) keeps a release
PR open on `master` and updates it from Conventional Commits. Merging that PR
tags `vX.Y.Z`, updates `CHANGELOG.md` and creates the GitHub Release, which
starts the release build. Never tag by hand.

Until the first release is near, the release PR is paused: the
release-please job runs only when the repository variable
`RELEASES_ENABLED` is `true`. Every update of the release PR runs the full
check suite, which holds runners that feature PRs wait for. To resume, run
`gh variable set RELEASES_ENABLED --body true --repo vascoguita/yapyap`; the
next push to `master` opens the release PR again with every change since the
last release.

Release notes are generated from commit subjects, and only `feat`, `fix`,
`perf` and `revert` commits appear in them. Each change appears once: the
release workflow merges the entry release-please writes for a commit with
the one for its pull request's merge commit (#358). A fix for a publicly known
vulnerability uses the `security` scope and names its advisory in the
subject, for example
`fix(security): validate plugin manifests before parsing (GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx)`,
so the release notes list the CVE or GHSA ID of every vulnerability the
release fixes. If the advisory becomes public only after the release, add
its ID to that release's entry in `CHANGELOG.md` and to the GitHub Release
notes.

The release build (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) reuses the same packaging
(`package.yml`) and smoke tests (`smoke.yml`) as pull requests:

1. Every package format is built for every architecture, with the release
   stamped into the AppStream metainfo. Builds are signed and notarized only
   with the secrets that exist; missing ones produce a notice and unsigned
   builds.
2. Every package is installed and launched against the fake WhatsApp page.
3. The installers, the Flatpak bundles, the auto-update metadata
   (`latest*.yml` and `.blockmap` files), a CycloneDX SBOM and `SHA256SUMS`
   are attached to the release, with signed build provenance attestations.
4. A PKGBUILD and `.SRCINFO` for `yapyap-bin` are generated from the
   release's Debian packages, attached to the release, and pushed to the AUR
   when `AUR_SSH_KEY` exists. Pull requests build and install the same
   PKGBUILD in an Arch Linux container.

The release page exists for about 40 minutes before its assets arrive, so the
updater must treat a release without update metadata as "no update yet".

The first release is v0.1.0 (`initial-version`). The release PR stays open
until the milestone that ships it is complete. Before 1.0, `feat` commits
bump the patch version. To ship a milestone release such as v0.2.0, add a
commit whose body has a `Release-As: 0.2.0` footer.
